# LaunchHacks

See our [repl](https://replit.com/@Jasamarbir/Launch-Hacks), the IDE we used to collaboratively code.

## Our project
(Money manager: People across the United States are in sevre credit card debt this has lead to financially insecurities. To combat this ever advancing problem we have designed the Money Manager Simulator, which will tell people how much money they will be able to spend each year, based on factors such as their electricity bill, their rent, or even a vacation they want to take. Furthermore, we also incorporated real time stock data allowing the user to obtain the feeling of owning shares in the stock market.Our project contains three python files (main.py,  stocks.py and buy.py). Main.py was used to ask the user questions, and buy.py was used for stocks. We then combined these two files to create one program, that is extremely useful to the user. We hope this tool will, help many families,  with their financially consulting.)
